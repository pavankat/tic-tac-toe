Made an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game with some typography to make it look nice.

I broke a lot of what I did into functions and used arrays where appropriate. 

The AI loops through a multidimensional array of winning combinations and when none of the combinations are in danger of being filled, the computer will always try to go for the middle square. If the middle square isn't available, then the computer will fill in the first empty square.
